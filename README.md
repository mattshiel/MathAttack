The Math Attack is a take on classic overhead shooters! Developed for Windows Devices.


## Prerequisites

**You must have a computer with a minimum of Visual Studio 2017 installed**

**If you have a Mac you will need Paralells or a hardware virtualizer of your choice to run Visual Studio 20xx**

## Installation

Currently the app is not available on the Window's Store but it has been submitted for certification.

In the meantime the only way to play The Math Attack is to clone it to your local machine and run it from Visual Studio.

1. Open your terminal or command line (if you're on a Mac you will need Parallels or some other hardware visualisation tool)

2. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/mattshiel/TheMathAttack`

3. Change directory into the project and open ***MathAttack*** folders until you see ***MathAttack.sln***, open this file.

4. You should now see the solution open in Visual Studio. Run on local machine to play **The Math Attack**.

**Additional Note** 

This game references the NuGet packages Win2D.uwp or Win2D.win81, which will be automatically downloaded when you build the sample, so there is no need to separately install Win2D itself.
